Write in a poetic style with flowing rhythm, vivid metaphors, and lyrical language. Use imagery that paints pictures in the reader's mind. Incorporate alliteration, assonance, and other sound devices. Make each sentence feel like a verse that could be set to music. Use elevated, beautiful language that stirs emotions and creates a sense of wonder.
